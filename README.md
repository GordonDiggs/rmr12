### Sandi Metz (@sandimetz): Go Ahead, Make a Mess

* Objects just need to be more stable than the things that depend on it
* Good OO Design will help manage the mess
* What to do with messy code that has no dependencies (that is the end of the line, like a method that doesn't call anything else)?
  * If it doesn't need to change, leave it. You will never know less than you know now.
  * You can still do a little refactoring
* Unstable dependencies need to be moved
* It's better to send a message than implement behavior
  * Hide the mess by delegating more
  * Factories can help (ie. for delegating something to types `#{class_name}ShockCost`)

### Ben Orenstein (@r00k): Refactoring from Good to Great

* Extracting to methods means you aren't tempted to read how it's done
* Repeated params are a data clump - you can move them into their own class
  * ie. `@start_date` and `@end_date` become `DateRange.new(start, end)`
* Refactor with tests
* `arr.inject(&:+)`: Sum values in 1.9
* Null Object Pattern
  * `@contact = contact || NullContact.new`
  * `NullContact` returns default values for when contact is absent
  * Some methods can just do nothing
  * Removes checks for `if contact.present?`
  * `NullContact` can be a singleton
  * Can help with logged in / logged out logic as well (`current_user.welcome_message`)
* Not everything works everywhere (_Tell, don't ask_ not necessarily good for views)
* Depend Upon Abstractions
  * Extract stuff into wrapper classes
* When do you refactor?
  * Refactor god objects (usually `User` and whatever your app really uses)
  * Files that change a lot ([danmayer/churn](https://github.com/danmayer/churn))
  * Places that you find bugs
    * You found the bug because you didn't understand the code in the first place

### Justin Searls: To Mock or Not To Mock

* How much reality does a test need?
  * Acceptance tests need a high level of reality
* Tests should be readable to let the next person know how something works
* What value will I get out of this test?
* Use isolation tests to drive design, end-to-end tests to prove it works (the GOOS way)
* Object surface area: how many public methods are on it

### Roy Tomeij (@roy): Modular & Reusable Front End Code / The Joy of Front-End

* Bob Ross created modular painting
* [roy.io/book](http://roy.io/book)
* Modular HTML5
  * Sectioning elements can start with h1
  * Modernizr for IE
* Modular CSS
  * Determine and re-use common elements
  * Print out designs and cross out unique elements
  * Refactoring
    * Give similar modules a new class name, style that
    * Make a new css file (clean code goes in clean files)
  * Namespace modules (`mod-foo`)
  * Use generic class names and shallow selectors
  * Use a second class name for specific instances, rather than scoping
    * Second class names don't need to be semantic in naming
  * Use media queries in sass
* Modular JS
  * Use IDs for javascript and testing only
  * Use data attributes instead of classes to target multiple elements
    * [roy.io/datatest](http://roy.io/datatest)
    * Slightly slower than using classes

### Stephan Hagemann (@shageman): Wrangling Large Rails Codebases

* [shageman/the\_next\_big\_thing](http://github.com/shageman/the_next_big_thing)
* Organize models into namespaced Modules
  * adds some structure but doesn't help much else
* Gems bring their own specs
  * the gem only deals with its own stuff
* Higher cohesion inside, looser coupling outside
* Annoyance gem
* use unbuilt gems, require by path
  * `gem "annoyance", path: 'gems/annoyance'`
* Rails engines can wrap behavior
  * use `mount` in routes
  * `isolate_namespace` in engine
* Putting things in boxes won't solve a lot of problems, but it will help

* Different stakeholders care about different things. Present the right context.

### Russ Olsen: Eloquent Explanations

* The only way we can get smarter is to explain things to each other
* Five ways to make your explanations stick:
  * Take Explaining Seriously
     * Have a plan
     * Don't try to explain everything all at once
  * Be Agile
    * Do it, measure it, fix it, repeat
  * Put the important stuff first
    * Explaining is a timed event
    * Terminology is not the important stuff
    * Supply small victories
    * Tell them it's hard after explaining
  * Don't add extra things
    * Repeat yourself for emphasis and context
  * Mix in some humor
    * _Numerical Methods that Work_ by Forman S. Acton
    * Don't let them get in the way
    * Subtle is better
* Always show up
